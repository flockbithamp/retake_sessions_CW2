                Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[31]

                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
